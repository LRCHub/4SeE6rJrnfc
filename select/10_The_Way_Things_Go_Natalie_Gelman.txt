Sitting tight on the edge of my tongue
Silent and ready to burn you like a shot gun
If the truth needs an angel or the devil his muse
And we're already lost then there's nothing to lose
Tall tales, loose lies, love songs, alibis
Another day in paradise if you keep your eyes closed
Tall tales, loose lies, love songs, alibis
All just seems to be the way things go
The way things go
Maybe love isn't what it's all about
What does you in is the thing that you can't live without
But it's enough to be with you tonight
If you don't know what's wrong well then just maybe it's right
Tall tales, loose lies, love songs, alibis
Another day in paradise if you keep your eyes closed
Tall tales, loose lies, love songs, alibis
All just seems to be the way things go
The way things go
Would you come down, would you come down
Would you come down and have your way with me?
Would you come down, would you come down
Would you come down and stay with me?
Tall tales, loose lies, love songs, alibis
Another day in paradise if you keep your eyes closed
Tall tales, loose lies, love songs, alibis
All just seems to be the way things go
The way things go
The way things go
The way things go
